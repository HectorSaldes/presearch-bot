### Introduction
Hello, world!

Not that long ago, [Presearch](https://presearch.com/signup?rid=4334054) got announced to the world, a search engine what gives you free crypto.
The search engine it selves sucks, but what I invented doesn't. This is Cleo, the Presearch bot. The only working one (currently). Why did I call it Cleo? I don't know.

This tool allows you to:

 - Earn money without doing anything
 - Bypass the rate limits
 - And that's it. Yeah, I didn't knew anything else to put here lol
 
 ### Installation
Just wanted to say, if you enjoyed my project, please consider using my [referral link](https://presearch.com/signup?rid=4334054).

-----------
To start, download the latest [release](https://github.com/lgamerlive/presearch-bot/releases/new) from my GitHub page and download it. Unzip the file and put the files in a folder (see [this](https://i.vgy.me/VADfFk.png) image, if you even need help with that).
Now, navigate to your browsers extension page.

    Chrome/Chromium-based browsers: chrome://extensions/
    Microsoft edge: edge://extensions/
    FireFox: about:addons
   Now, you need to enable Developer Mode (see image) ![Enabling Developer Mode in Google Chrome](https://i.vgy.me/QnoRyz.png)
   Select "Load Unpacked"
